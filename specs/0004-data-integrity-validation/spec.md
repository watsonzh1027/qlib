# Feature Specification: Data Integrity Validation

**Feature Branch**: `glib-crypto`
**Created**: November 15, 2025
**Status**: Completed
**Input**: Add data integrity validation to OKX data collector to check data continuity before downloading updates and clear corrupted data

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Data Integrity Validation (Priority: P1)

As a data engineer, I want the system to automatically validate data continuity before downloading new data so that I can prevent accumulation of corrupted data over time.

**Why this priority**: This is critical for maintaining data quality in trading systems where corrupted data can lead to poor trading decisions.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by running data collection with corrupted existing data and verifying that corrupted data is cleared before fresh downloads.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** existing CSV data with timestamp gaps, **When** running data collection, **Then** corrupted data should be cleared and fresh data downloaded
2. **Given** existing database data with duplicates, **When** running data collection, **Then** corrupted data should be cleared and fresh data downloaded
3. **Given** continuous data with good coverage, **When** running data collection, **Then** data should be preserved and new data appended

### User Story 2 - Comprehensive Validation Checks (Priority: P2)

As a developer, I want detailed validation that checks for gaps, duplicates, and coverage so that I can ensure high-quality trading data.

**Why this priority**: Comprehensive validation provides better data quality assurance and debugging capabilities.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by creating test data with various corruption scenarios and verifying all validation checks work correctly.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** data with timestamp gaps > 2x expected interval, **When** validating, **Then** validation should fail
2. **Given** data with duplicate timestamps, **When** validating, **Then** validation should fail
3. **Given** data with < 80% coverage, **When** validating, **Then** validation should fail
4. **Given** good continuous data, **When** validating, **Then** validation should pass

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

<!--
  IMPORTANT: User stories should be PRIORITIZED as user journeys ordered by importance.
  Each user story/journey must be INDEPENDENTLY TESTABLE - meaning if you implement just ONE of them,
  you should still have a viable MVP (Minimum Viable Product) that delivers value.
  
  Assign priorities (P1, P2, P3, etc.) to each story, where P1 is the most critical.
  Think of each story as a standalone slice of functionality that can be:
  - Developed independently
  - Tested independently
  - Deployed independently
  - Demonstrated to users independently
-->

### User Story 1 - [Brief Title] (Priority: P1)

[Describe this user journey in plain language]

**Why this priority**: [Explain the value and why it has this priority level]

**Independent Test**: [Describe how this can be tested independently - e.g., "Can be fully tested by [specific action] and delivers [specific value]"]

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** [initial state], **When** [action], **Then** [expected outcome]
2. **Given** [initial state], **When** [action], **Then** [expected outcome]

### Edge Cases

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: The content in this section represents placeholders.
  Fill them out with the right edge cases.
-->

- What happens when [boundary condition]?
- How does system handle [error scenario]?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: The content in this section represents placeholders.
  Fill them out with the right functional requirements.
-->

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST [specific capability, e.g., "allow users to create accounts"]
- **FR-002**: System MUST [specific capability, e.g., "validate email addresses"]  
- **FR-003**: Users MUST be able to [key interaction, e.g., "reset their password"]
- **FR-004**: System MUST [data requirement, e.g., "persist user preferences"]
- **FR-005**: System MUST [behavior, e.g., "log all security events"]

*Example of marking unclear requirements:*

- **FR-006**: System MUST authenticate users via [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: auth method not specified - email/password, SSO, OAuth?]
- **FR-007**: System MUST retain user data for [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: retention period not specified]

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*

- **[Entity 1]**: [What it represents, key attributes without implementation]
- **[Entity 2]**: [What it represents, relationships to other entities]

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: Define measurable success criteria.
  These must be technology-agnostic and measurable.
-->

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: [Measurable metric, e.g., "Users can complete account creation in under 2 minutes"]
- **SC-002**: [Measurable metric, e.g., "System handles 1000 concurrent users without degradation"]
- **SC-003**: [User satisfaction metric, e.g., "90% of users successfully complete primary task on first attempt"]
- **SC-004**: [Business metric, e.g., "Reduce support tickets related to [X] by 50%"]
