# TODO: Optimize Code Coverage for scripts/setup_project_structure.py

## Steps to Complete
- [ ] Refactor scripts/setup_project_structure.py to add a main() function containing the __main__ logic
- [ ] Update tests/test_setup_dirs.py to use capsys in test_main_execution instead of subprocess
- [ ] Run pytest with coverage to verify 100% coverage for the file
- [ ] Create issue file in issues/ directory documenting the fix
